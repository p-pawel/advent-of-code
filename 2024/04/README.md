# AoC 2024: Day 04

## Run with sample data
```bash
cd rust
cargo run < ../sample.txt
cd ..
```

## Early observations
- I like the practice of keeping unit tests in the same file along with the production code
- I'm acquiring some "basic expertise" with Rust (but I believe some vector operations, such as x+1, y+1, or "len" calls, that are resembling a bit old plain C, could be replaced with some higher level operations)
