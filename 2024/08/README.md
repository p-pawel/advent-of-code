# AoC 2024: Day 08

It's Sunday, so I wanted to get over with it and put the todays puzzle behind me as soon as possible, hence I picked Java again.

## Part 1 and Part 2

```bash
cd java
mvn -q clean compile exec:java < ../sample.txt 
cd ..
```
## Observations

- I enjoyed again almost going on autopilot mode where I could focus on the right part, so that a puzzle is the puzzle, not the language syntax
