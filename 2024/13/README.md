# AoC 2024: Day 13

## Context

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/13

## Part 1 + Part 2

```bash
cd day13
./gradlew -q run < ../sample.txt
cd ..
```

## Observations

- quick win, based on Java experience and awareness of it's libs

- Apache Math could be a too big gun for this problem, as we have a system of only 2 equations here, but I wanted to be sure that any corner cases of matrix-processing are handled

- still, it could be worth to get rid of float from the processing flow
